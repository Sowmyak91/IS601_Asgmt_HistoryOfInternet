    <h2><a href="#acc1">Evolution of Capitalism</a></h2>
    <p>21st century humans have come up with an awful lot of entertaining ways of filling up the few free moments in our over schedule lives. We dance we surf and ski week aboard and canoodle and watch TV but what diversion do we love most of all nano man we love to spend. Every time we whip out a piece of plastic and slap it down to buy some fresh bling, we're taking part in a noble tradition the evolution of capitalism. But now a new phase of capitalism is upon us the age of e-commerce, An age that change the way the business works the way we buy and sell, An age assured in by a transformative technology the world wide web and by two of its seminal companies amazon.com and eBay. </p>
	<p>It's easy to forget just how revolutionary these companies were when they first burst upon the scene back in the 1990s how they shook big business to its very core ever since the Industrial Revolution corporations have always been based on the power of high-flying executives sitting in their gilded offices way up there with the consumer almost as an afterthought. But now Amazon and eBay were creating a whole new model of commerce one based on taking the internet and harnessing the power of the great mass of individuals.</p>

    <h2><a href="#acc2">Amazon.com</a></h2>
    <p>Its a cliche, but big things in high-tech took in garage, where according to high-tech lore the greatest startups were incubated hewlett-packard, Apple the list goes on and is for amazon.com. It was in suburban Seattle and belonged to a guy named Jeff Bezos. He started out on Wall Street in the early 1990s he was highly analytical a spreadsheet junkie and when the web came along he started thinking in a systematic way about its unique properties and what kinds of stuff it would be ideal for selling. He made a list after list and always at the top it was books there are millions of books active and imprint around the world and you could build something online and there couldn't exist any other way to have a physical bookstore with millions of titles. Bezos launched Amazon in the summer of 1995. In the first 30 days after Amazon went live with its first employees sitting at desks, the site shipped books to 45 different countries and all 50 US states. Favour of rapid growth strategy Bezos boiled down to three simple words get big fast.

    <h2><a href="#acc3">eBay</a></h2>
    <p>In 1995,  around same time Amaon was launched, down in Silicon Valley another young guy Pierre Omidyar was thinking hard about the web to today. Omidyar is a multi billionaire but back then he was just another idealistic software programmer but one who had an interesting idea, the idea that would become eBay. Pierre didn't have a business plan he hadn't done any market research he was just a humble software coder who thought that the idea of making an online auction site sounded pretty cool. It was an idea that he could take care of all by himself tapping away at his home computer. He thought, maybe use the web and use the power of this technology to bring people in one place to create a market place. A market mechanism that was actually truly efficient where regular people could compete on a level playing field with the big players. An auction site on the web would be fairer and more accessible than any existing market so he decided to make it happen all by himself over one long holiday weekend in September 1995, He started writing code and it was it was really simple create an item, list an item and get a list of all the items that have been created and then you could bid on an item. It was just those three things.</p>

    <h2><a href="#acc4">Collision of 2 Techs</a></h2>
    <p>Collision of two technologies and the pair of laws that made them unique in the history of mankind. The first technology was the silicon chip governed by what's called Moore's law coined by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore more than 40 years ago. Moore's law states but the speed and power of integrated circuits from microprocessors to memory chips doubles every 18 months. From 1 to a million you only need 20 steps, in very few steps you get tremendous growth. This logic-defying doubling stems, engineers ability to make transistors smaller and smaller and computers have gone from giant machines that fill up entire rooms super-powerful laptops.</p>
	<p>Another rule known as Metcalfe's law coined by Robert Metcalfe inventor of Ethernet. Metcalfe's law says that every new node meaning something like your computer that's added to the network doesn't just increase the networks value by plus one the curve is much much steeper than that. It's the Moore's law of connectivity and this is how it works if we have two users and that's one connection between them they can each talk to each other and increases.This is the growth of the internet,to say as the number of users increases the usefulness of the network increases and it becomes even more compelling.

    <h2><a href="#acc5">Public key cryptography</a></h2>
    <p>Trio of california-based mathematicians named Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle developed something called public key cryptography. Their scheme turned how encryption had been done for centuries on its head. The essential idea which is brilliant but kind of subtle. The sender puts a message in a box, this time instead oflocking it with her own padlock she asks the person who will receive the message to buy a padlock and send it to her. when the sender gets the padlock she uses it to lock the box and then sends it now if someone intercepts the box they can open it in fact even the sender can't open the box once it's locked. The only person who can open it is the intended recipient the only person who has the code. Its perfect security it took several years in some very clever math to create Internet friendly digital versions of the padlocks and boxes used in our analogy. Public key cryptography is the linchpin of secure ecommerce the public key is used for encrypting that is rendering secret the data that the sender wishes to send confidentially to the receiver. And private key which is the combination used by the receiver in order to take the encrypted data, decrypt them and produce the original message that's readable with consumers flocking to Amazon on the basis of their competence and secure convenient ecommerce</p>

    <h2><a href="#acc6">dot-com boom</a></h2>
    <p>The Amazon and eBay IPOs made Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar richer than Croesus on paper at least but they also had an even larger effect the IPOs made them famous as their story spread they inspired legions of imitators business school students from across the country who suddenly started packing up their cars and heading for Silicon Valley. 1999 was a wild year almost impossible to fathom now from the start of the boom in 1995 there had never been more than 30 internet companies to go public in any given year in 1999 the total number of internet IPO s was 250 but eBay and Amazon stood head and shoulders above the rest of the dot-com crowd eBay's market value on the Nasdaq was now 21 billion dollars and it was even profitable. It was very unreal from a stock market point of view. American business icons but more cynical Minds read it another way as a sign that the epicenters of the Internet bubble may have been Silicon Valley and Wall Street but there was one central player who resided in Washington DC the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Alan Greenspan.The Greenspan famously said that irrational exuberance was fueling the bubble. Greenspan believed that technology was creating a new economy one were the old rules no longer applied but after witnessing the stock market's crazy run up in 1999 and after glimpsing signs that the overall economy was dangerously close to overheating.</p>
